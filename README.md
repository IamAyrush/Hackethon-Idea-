Our project is an innovative trading platform designed for movie lovers and those who enjoy speculative interactions. The concept revolves around users engaging with movie trailers and making informed predictions on whether the movie will be a blockbuster or fail to meet expectations at the box office. After watching the trailer, users can make a prediction on the movie’s success, essentially 'trading' their insights. Based on the movie’s actual performance upon release, users will either gain or lose virtual currency, providing a fun and rewarding experience that blends entertainment with strategy.


𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀 :

Users begin by watching trailers of upcoming movies, after which they have the option to predict the success or failure of the film. To make predictions, users rely on their understanding of the genre, cast, director, and storyline, as well as their knowledge of past trends in the film industry. Once they lock in their prediction, the movie’s box office performance will be tracked, and as the real data comes in (e.g., opening weekend performance, total earnings), users will see how accurate their predictions were. Their virtual currency balance will adjust accordingly, based on the difference between predicted and actual results.
